"Swag Worth A Million"
(feat. Cooley)

It's the king bitch

Swag worth a million
Swag worth a million
Rich kids like a [?]

[Chorus:]
Swag is in the building
Good is how we feelin
Fresh to death but still alive
My swag is worth a million

Swag is in the building
(Swag worth a million)
Good is how we feelin
Fresh to death but still alive
(Swagg worth a million)
My swag is worth a million

Swag worth a million
(Swag worth a million)
Game worth a trillion
(Swag worth a million)
[x4]

Oh my god
Okay

Cooley's in the buildin
Hundred dollar billin
Fresh to death but still alive
My swag is worth a million
That Aston Martin paint [?]
color look like they armadillon
My necklace is coolin it
bracelet is chillin
Man I love women
All these pretty pretty women
They smilin I be grinning
Cause I'm in the mood for swimming
I could backstroke yo girlfriend
Stroke her till the world end
Pull up on these bitches with my 26's twirling
Baby you ain't got me even when you got yo pearls in
First class flight we on our way to Berlin
I'm gone do my Prada shots you gone do yo [?] then
If you gettin money say fuck that shit don't worry then

[Chorus]

I swag too hard stay on my guard
moneys not an option
I heard we what you lookin for
I see that you be watchin
Go hard for the gold
The charts is what we toppin
15 digits let em spend it
Bentleys what we parking
You know I'm blessed
I won't stress
green light to the dark shit
A million man smile
With a trillion man swag
Aw yeah they hate me
they keep in a bag
Show a couple grand
just to upgrade yo class first

Swag worth a million baby I'm gone
You could get some swag
just from listening to this song
I do this for my sister I do this for my dad
If it weren't for them baby
I wouldn't have a [?]
I do this for my momma
She gone shed tears
If it weren't for her baby
I wouldn't be here
Swag worth a million I will never fall
Ima three point shooter
Baby you can balllll

[Chorus]

Rich kids gettin money
That's what everybody's tellin me
Swagger jack is a crime
Police hittin em with the felony
My partna got that old man swag from the 70's
Me and my partna Caleb hit the road
Now we on seven seas
Swag is in the building
Our swag is like a killing
Come and get a healing
Futuristic feeling
The [?] got a million
They act like they don't hear me
They don't understand
That this life is what I'm livin yeah

Okay now rich is how I'm livin
And my swag is at a trilli
Bitch this how we kick it?
11 hundred with the meal b?
Like Pablo say I'm illy
Typically? Games I still see
Call me 6 zero cause I'm lookin like a milli
Any nigga swaggin in Atlanta gotta feel me
Gucci with the real G's
26's will read?
Tangerine polo fit a bitch
That tried to peel me
Lamborghini with their women
In case they wanna peal me

[Chorus]
